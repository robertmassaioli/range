 - The following assumptions must be maintained at the beginning of these internal

 - RangeMerge assumptions:
 - * The span ranges will never overlap the bounds.
 - * The span ranges are always sorted in ascending order by the first element.
 - * The lower and upper bounds never overlap in such a way to make it an infinite range.
